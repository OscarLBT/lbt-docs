It is recommended that you see the instructions for checking stock prior to proceeding with shopping instructions.


## Samples

Samples can be added to your cart from either the Stock Check page or the Product page’s variations section by clicking on the item’s cart icon. Note, this is only possible with sample items.

## Inventory

Inventory items can only be added from their respective product page. Prior to adding inventory items to your cart, you must change the default --MSRP-- value on the Product page to the customer you wish to shop on behalf of or to your account, or alternately to ONE-TIME PURCHASE if there is no associated account.
Once an account is selected, the <i>Add To Cart</i> button will be enabled on the Product Page. Quantity can be inputted in one of two units of measure when available. Here we’ve inputted 3 pieces which is auto-calculated out to 3.27sqft.

Once your cart has an inventory item in it, the account cannot be changed. The only way to clear the selected account is by clicking on <span style="color:red">Clear Cart</span> from the Shopping Cart. The Shopping Cart is accessed from the shopping bag icon on the top-right of the page.

## Checking Out
Once you have finished selecting items, click on <i>Checkout Now</i> in your Shopping Cart.
A custom address can be manually inputted for any given account. If you wish to ship to an existing address, you can double click inside of the first Address field and the customer’s selectable list of addresses will display. Alternatively, you can begin typing in that field and any matching address will display. Once an address is selected, the fields will auto-fill.

The Notes field can be used for any information you wish to pass to the CSR. These notes will not display on order confirmations sent from GP.
On the top-right of the Delivery Details and Order Summary page, a discount code can be selected. These discounts are currently only applied in GP. The Samples (30% off) discount will apply a 30% discount to inventory items which have a piece/sheet quantity of 3 or less. The Rebate discount code will apply rebate to applicable items in GP.

Once you have filled the shipping fields, you can either click on Continue to proceed with the ordering process which will import the order into GP or you can click on Save as quote.


## Custom Items

Many collections do not have a specific item code for every sample board. In those cases, you will have to select a custom sample board item. For example, if you need a 6X12 sample board of Tomei 1X1 Cotton Natural, you would have to choose the corresponding Tomei 1X1 custom sample board item and edit its description. 
Item descriptions are only editable on custom items.
The process is the same for custom swatch cards and custom blends.

If you need to add multiple instances of the same custom item in your cart, you can click on the copy button which will add a new instance of the item to the bottom of the cart.

Note, the copy button is only enabled in the shopping cart panel.



## Quotes

Quotes can be accessed by expanding the Web Orders section on the left pane.

After selecting a quote by clicking on <i>View quote details</i>, you can either click on <i>Submit as Order</i> to have the quote processed in GP as an order or you can click on <i>Edit</i> to update item details and add or remove items. If you wish to send a quote to your client, you can click on the <i>Print</i> button and select <i>Print to PDF</i> for the Destination option to save the print out to a PDF file.

## Editing Quotes

Currently, the only fields editable in the quote header are the PO Number and Notes. Items can be added, removed, or have their quantities updated.
Descriptions for custom item codes can also be updated.

Clicking on the <i>+ Add Item</i> button enables a search box similar to the Global Search wherein you can type in an item code or Series, Size, Color, Finish, & Format to search for an item.
In this example, we've added AGT-1X1-CUSTOM by searching "agate 1x1 custom inventory" and inputted a custom description.

Note, once an item is selected, the input field is locked. If you wish to remove the new item, click on the <i>Cancel</i> button. Existing items and non-custom items cannot have their description edited.
