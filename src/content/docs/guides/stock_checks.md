## Global Search

There are multiple ways you can check stock on our portal.
Often, the most efficient way of checking stock is by using our Global Search which is always located at the top-left of the page to the right of the LBT logo. This is accomplished by either typing either an item code or Series, Size, Color, and Finish separated by spaces.
Using Agate 1X1 Amalfi Pearl as an example:


Item Number            |  Series, Size, Color, Finish
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:

When there is an exact item match in the Global Search, the portal will display the item’s lot break down towards the bottom. If there isn’t an exact match as on the right example, the global search will display the largest lot quantity out of CA. You can click on the link of the material of your choosing to go to its Product Page.


## Product Page

Once on the Product Page, the “in stock” and Material on order sections can be expanded to display their respective information. The quantity displayed in the “in stock” header is the largest lot quantity out of CA.

At the bottom of the Product Page under the Hamburger tab, you can also see stock of related items.
The results can be filtered as either Color or Pattern variations and/or Inventory or Swatch format. They can also be further narrowed down with the small search box on the right.

## Stock Check Page

Another method of checking stock is by clicking on Stock Check which should always be located on the left navigation pane.
In the following example, we’ve again used the Series, Size, Color, and Finish to filter the results along with the Format of “Inventory” and minimum quantity of 60. QTY is the sum of CA lots, MAX LOT QTY is the largest lot available out of CA.
Additional lot info and backorder info can be seen by clicking on the info icon under MAX LOT QTY and ON ORDER.
