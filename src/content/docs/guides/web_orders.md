## Introduction

Sales reps will be able to submit POs on behalf of their customers using the LBT web portal. This process should save time for both CSRs and Samples Department as it will be replacing the Excel sheets that are used as POs


## Receiving and Review

When a sales rep submits a PO through the LBT web portal, it is processed automatically as a real order in GP. This order will need to be reviewed against the *web order processed* email which is sent out upon order entry.

The requested ship date is based on the ship method and time of day that the order is processed. This will have to be updated manually by the CSR depending on if the order has an issue, has made to order items, etc.

When there are no backordered items encountered, the email will only include this basic header information.

By comparison, if an order has out of stock items, they will display in the email.

The sales reps may include notes on the order which will be displayed at the bottom of the email. These notes will not be reflected in the order. They are generally going to be instructions for the CSR. If any notes need to be created for the warehouse, the CSR will have to do that in the order's comment ID field.


## Fulfillment

Once the order is reviewed and any necessary edits made to it, it can be treated like any other. All that needs to happen is for it to be put into the HC-SHIP batch. It will then be printed and sent to the appropriate department.


## Additional notes

As of writing, a 30% sample discount on loose inventory items and rebate are automatically applied when the sales rep selects that option from the portal.

On custom items, the sales rep is able to input a description which is reflected on the item's description in GP.

This process is meant to encompass the most common sampling scenarios. There will be times that call for emails between the CSR and the sales rep or where other updates need to be made to the order.
