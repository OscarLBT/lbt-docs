- Added exclusivity filter.
  - Exclusivity filter allows for stock checks to be pre-filtered by private material only, private + regular material, or regular inventory only. This is per dealer.


## June 2023
- Added timestamp for data refresh on multiple pages.
  - If changes were made on our ERP system (GP), users sometimes wondered why their updates weren't immediately reflected in the portal.

## May 2023
- Enabled shipment tracking on Invoices page.
  - Users can now, if available, click on a tracking number link which takes them directly to the carrier's tracking page.

- Added PA stock.
  - Stock checks were previously limited to CA inventory only. This slowed down CSRs when they had to help east coast customers.
- Updated quantities to selling unit of measure.
  - There should be consistency between the units of measure on the Portal and the pricelist.  
- Added item specifications to product page.
  - While mounting type, thickness, weight, etc can be looked up in a pricelist, finding that information on the Portal is more effecient.

## April 2023
- Unveiled Portal to CSRs.
- Added Invoices page.
  - This provides an alternative to GP when a user needs to search for an invoice by its tracking number.

- Added SharePoint links to Invoices page.
  - Clicking on the link provided in the <i>PO Number</i> column takes the user to a prefilled SharePoint search page which lists files associated with the purchase order.
- Added Open Orders page.
<img src="/docs/assets/images/open_orders_example.png" alt="none" style="border: 1px solid  gray;">
- Enabled consolidation information on Open Orders page.
  - Users can now click on consolidation links within the <i>CONS.</i> column. This takes them to a printable consolidation list page which streamlines the order fulfillment process.

    A caveat of this process is that Requested Ship Dates must be consistent in order for orders to display on the same consolidation.
